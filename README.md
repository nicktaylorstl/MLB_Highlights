# MLB_Highlights
This is my first attempt at creating a flask web app. 

I used the free MLB stats API to get links to player highlight videos.

With the webapp you can select a player name and a specific date or a full month and it will return links to all of the highlight videos of that player from the specified time. 

You can access it here https://mlb-highlights.onrender.com/
